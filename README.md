# Mini project - A Todo List with react

### Description

The Todo App is a very simple web application that allows users to create a list of tasks to do. Users can add todo tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list. It's also possible to edit a todo if needed.
For now the list of completed todos is not yet complete, so I have temporarily created three completed todos.

### Tools

- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- React Router

### How to run my project:

1. Use the command `npm install` in the terminal to install all necessary packages and dependencies for the project.

2. Use the command `npm run dev` in the terminal to start the development server. This will compile and start your application, enabling hot reloading for easier development.
